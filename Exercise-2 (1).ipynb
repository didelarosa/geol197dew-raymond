You will also get to practice the Markdown syntax. \n\nExercise 2 consists of 3 problems. For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own solutions. **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change**! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (yes, it can happen!).\n\n**Please don't change the file name**. Do all of your editing in the provided `Exercise-2.ipynb` file (this file). \n\n- **Exercise 2 is due by the start of the next lesson**.\n- **We are [working in pairs](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/why-pairs.html) on this exercise**, and we will only grade the repository of the driver in your pair for this week's exercise.\n\n## Please note\n\n- The Python code cells where you should make changes will contain text that reads\n\n  ```Python\n  # YOUR CODE HERE\n  raise NotImplementedError()\n  ```\n  **You should delete that text and replace it with your code** to answer the associated question.\n- Some of the cells in this Jupyter Notebook are \"Read-only\" which means that you are not able to edit them.\n- Some of the code cells contain tests. If these tests fail (you see an error message), you know there is still something wrong with your code.\n- **Please do not copy/paste code cells in this notebook**. We use an automated grading system that will fail if there are copies of code cells.\n\n## Where to find help\n\n- Review the [materials for Lesson 2](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/overview.html)\n- Check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/exercise-2.html#exercise-2-hints) on the course webpage","metadata":{"deletable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"43d4af1666fb50a3356aaa2be8f1002a","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-577a4204893ab1a5","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem 0 - Cloning Exercise repository in JupyterLab (0 points)\n\n~~Before starting to work with the actual problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone **your own** Exercise 2 repository (e.g. `exercise-2-jdaled`) into the instance using **Git**. *Check [the Lesson 2 materials](https://geo-python-upd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html) for instructions on how to do this.*~~\n\nIf you are working on Binder, navigate to your personal repository that was created after you accepted the exercise invite.
